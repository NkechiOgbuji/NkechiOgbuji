## # 👋 Hello, I’m Nkechi Queeneth Ogbuji

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I’m an entry-level DevOps and Cloud Security engineer focused on learning by building and understanding how real systems work. I use Git and GitHub daily to manage projects with feature branches, clean commits, and proper merges, and I spend time exploring real-world repositories to learn how production code is structured and maintained.

I’m intentional about learning the right way — not just watching tutorials, but practicing version control, reading other people’s code, and understanding workflows used by real teams. This GitHub reflects my hands-on learning process, experiments, and steady progress as I grow my DevOps skill set.
