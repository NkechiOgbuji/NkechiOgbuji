**DevOps | Cloud Security | Learning by Building**

## About Me
I’m an entry-level DevOps and Cloud Security engineer focused on learning by building and understanding how real systems work. I use Git and GitHub daily to manage projects with feature branches, clean commits, and proper merges, and I spend time exploring real-world repositories to learn how production code is structured and maintained.
I’m intentional about learning the right way — not just watching tutorials, but practicing version control, reading other people’s code, and understanding workflows used by real teams. This GitHub reflects my hands-on learning process, experiments, and steady progress as I grow my DevOps skill set.

## Tools & Skills
- Git & GitHub (branching, commits, merges)
- Linux fundamentals
- Cloud & DevOps foundations
- CI/CD concepts
- Secure development basics

## Currently Learning
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Cloud infrastructure fundamentals  
- DevOps best practices and workflows  

## My Goal
To grow into a DevOps engineer who builds reliable and secure systems, understands both development and operations, and contributes meaningfully to team success.
