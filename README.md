🟡 **About Me**
---


I’m an entry-level DevOps and Cloud Security engineer focused on learning by building and understanding how real systems work.  
I use Git and GitHub daily with feature branches, clean commits, and proper merges, and I explore real-world repositories to understand how production code is structured and maintained.

I’m intentional about learning the right way — not just watching tutorials, but practicing version control, reading other people’s code, and understanding workflows used by real teams.
